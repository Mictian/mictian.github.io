# Who am I

Hi! Im __Mictian__, another web developer in the world.
I work with JavaScript, I enjoy the crazyness of this ecosystem, love Open Source and Pink Floyd - who says I'm just talking about technology?


Passionate agilist; Scrum Master and Scrum Developer but not interested in titles.
If you feel like contact me please check out my LinkedIn profile, link below.


## Why Mictian?

I know, there is a lot of crazy stufff out there if you look for my nickname. The thing is, I choose it a long time ago in the 90s when I was a kid.
At that time when I dreamed of becoming a singer (we all have crazy dreams when we are kids) I though that something related with 'mic' from microphone could be a great idea. And from that mictian was created.
My real name is Santiago, but I become so used to this nickname that I don't want to change it now.
